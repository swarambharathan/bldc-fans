## ENERGY EFFICIENT INNOVATIVE FANS: BLDC FANS

In India, most of the common people depends on ceiling fans to reduce the hot temperature
during summer season. Now-a-days improvised fans are available in the market. Usually electric
fans work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. It works with the help of an electric motor
which is embedded with coil of wire around a metallic core. As the current passes through the coils
of wire, it produces rotational motion due to electromagnetic induction. Usually, alternative current
is used in ceiling fan as it being connected directly to a power source. This power source help in
rotation of Motor. Here the conversion of energy take place from electrical to mechanical. Thus
the blades attached to the motor start moving with the spinning of coil. Primarly two blade fans
were available in the market, later it was upgraded to four blade fans for circulating more air.
Today the typical ceiling fan is based on AC motors which are power hungry . Along with this the
typical AC motor based fan have the RPM control through the capacitor or resistor based regulators
and it is not efficient as there is loss in the regulator itself to some extent. In addition the RPM
control is by controlling the voltage and the voltage fluctuations of the mains make it very
challenging to have constant RPM based on the AC main supply. The total amount of air flow is
based on the blade size and does not change due to any other factor.
For years, ceiling fans used to come with the same hardware of induction motor which
typically consumed 70-80 watts for a standard ceiling fan. Another popular style is the Table fan.
It can be placed on a table or the floor, or just about on anything with a firm base. The remarkable
thing about this kind of design is that you can direct the cool breeze in the direction you prefer,
and you could even let it swing. Other types include pedestal fan, which is used in a large hall,
wall mounted, tower fans, exhaust fans etc. An older version of fans are replaced by updated
technology with brushless direct current motor. As the name suggest current flows directly in one
direction. There are brushed DC motors and brushless DC motors. No friction, no spark, no noise
in brushless DC motors. Absence of brushes lessen the overall maintenance. Superior thermal
characteristics helps in reducing the size. Higher speed range and speed of operation with smaller
motor geometry and lighter in weight. Brushless DC motor used for wide variety of application
requirements such as in computer hardware’s, electric vehicles, industrial robots, washing machine,
compressors, fans pumps etc. Bureau of Energy Efficiency is the government agency that promotes
and monitors various programs for improving energy efficiency. They are the ones who give

energy star ratings which is on electronic appliances like ACs, refrigerators, washing machines etc.
BEE has started a program called Super-Efficient Equipment Program in February 2012 with the
intent to rate appliance on its energy consumption parameter and promote energy-efficient
consumer appliances. Ceiling fans were the first target of this program. Since the launch of this
program, many startups have come with the idea of ‘BLDC fans’ which are usually 5-star rated
and thus are highly energy efficient.
